*Investigating* - We have observed an error loading the Settings and Donor Directory pages in MyRaise. The error has been identified by Raise engineers and the infrastructure team is in the process of confirming and remedying the issue.

*Fix Implemented* - Changes were implemented May 5 to remedy the error, and the Donor Directory and Settings pages should now load as expected. We are continuing to monitor MyRaise functionality after the resolution.
