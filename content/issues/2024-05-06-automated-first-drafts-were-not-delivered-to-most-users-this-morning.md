**R﻿esolved** - We have confirmed First Draft delivery times, web app responsiveness and all other performance metrics have returned to normal, and all users have received their First Drafts from this morning. We are continuing to monitor performance throughout today and tomorrow and we are working to improve our automated alerts to more quickly respond to this type of error in the future, should it arise again.

**U﻿pdate** - All First Draft resends have been processed and performance is expected to return to normal within the next few minutes. Our engineers are continuing to monitor in order to confirm resolution of the issue.

**U﻿pdate** - Please expect delays in Rapid Fire and manually requested First Draft prompt sending, and potentially reduced performance of the web app, as we process the resends.

**U﻿pdate** - All First Draft prompts have been requeued and emails are currently sending out to all affected users. Some users should continue to expect duplicate prompts until the resend is complete.

**Update** - Our engineers are currently working to resend First Draft prompts to all affected users. Some users should expect to receive duplicate prompts as we process the resends.

**I﻿nvestigating** - An issue was detected this morning which has caused some automated First Draft prompts to fail to send. Our engineering team is currently investigating the root cause of the issue.
